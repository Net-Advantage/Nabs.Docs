# Inner Source

It should never be our intention that any one person "owns" any single part of the software within an organization.

The idea behind inner source is that the software is "collectively owned" and that anyone within the organisation should be able to contribute to the improvement of any part of the system given the following conditions:

- They follow the formal process to clarify and plan work.
- Any investigative work that is outside of the formal process (i.e., not properly clarified and planned) is on the developer's own time and must not interfere with already scheduled work assigned to the individual.
- Work done outside of the formal process that is ultimately accepted should be rewarded based on the value derived from the input.
