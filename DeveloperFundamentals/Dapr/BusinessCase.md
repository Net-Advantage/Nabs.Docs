## A Business Case for Dapr

The business case for Dapr lies in its ability to simplify the development of distributed applications. At its most basic level a console application that interacts with a redis container is by definition a distributed application.

When building distributed applications, developers often face challenges in interacting with various technologies and services across multiple cloud platforms. They need to learn and use multiple APIs from different libraries, which can be time-consuming and complex.

Dapr addresses these challenges by providing a runtime that abstracts away the complexities of interacting with different technologies and services. It offers a set of building blocks and APIs that developers can use to easily integrate with various components such as state management, pub/sub messaging, service invocation, and more.

By using Dapr, developers can focus on writing business logic without worrying about the underlying infrastructure and integration complexities. This leads to increased productivity, faster development cycles, and easier maintenance of distributed applications.

In summary, the business case for Dapr is to simplify the development of distributed applications by providing a unified runtime and set of APIs that abstract away the complexities of interacting with different technologies and services.The business case for Dapr (Distributed Application Runtime) lies in its ability to simplify the development of distributed applications.
